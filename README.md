# Mean Stack Trial

This repo follows the MEAN stack introduction from MongoDB, available here: https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/mean-stack-tutorial

Previously my expericence with Angular was using a Django API and SQL server on the backend. (If that has a cute acronym I don't know it. SQL, Django, Angular, Python... Let's call it PADS.)

Following this tutorial was a refresher on Angular concepts, and seeing how Angular had changed since I last used it a few years ago.

## Next Steps

Following the tutorial, I want to solidify and expand what I've learned by making some changes to the tutorial application.

* [ ] Fix the form so that it says "Edit" instead of "Add" when appropriate
* [ ] Convert templates from inline to extracted files
* [ ] Same with styles
* [ ] Convert all alert popups to in-app messages
* [ ] Learn more about reactive forms and add more fields to tinker with other functionality
